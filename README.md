# Deepfake Detection
## Overview
Misinformation on the internet has increasingly become a topic of concern in recent years. With this project, we hope to develop a system of neural networks that when feed videos or images can categorize them as real or fake. We have developed a system of ______ networks. For categorizing images, see the convolutional neural network. For categorizing videos, see the recurent or 3D convolutional network.

## Results and Model Performancs

## Running the neetwork
To feed a potentially deepfaked image or video to the convolutional or recurrent neural network respectively, use the NetworkTest.py file. Run The file and input the file location of either a video or image to get the model's classification (it may take a moment to prompt you to enter a path). Input "stop" to stop the program.
