# Deepfake Detection
## Overview
Misinformation on the internet has increasingly become a topic of concern in recent years. With this project, we hope to develop a system of neural networks that when feed videos or images can categorize them as real or fake. We have developed a system of ______ networks. For categorizing images, see the convolutional neural network. For categorizing videos, see the recurent or 3D convolutional network.

## Results and Model Performancs
(。・ω・。)

## Convolution Network Usage Instructions
To feed a potentially deepfaked image to the convolutional neural network, use the TestCNN.py file. Change the image_path variable to the path of the image you want to run through the network and run the file to view the network's prediction and confidence in the console.

## Recurrent Network Usage Instructions
To feed a potentially deepfaked image to the recurrent neural netowrk, use teh RNNtest.py file. Change the video_path variable to the path of the vieo that you want o run trhough the network and run the fiel to viewo the network's prediction and confidence in the console.
